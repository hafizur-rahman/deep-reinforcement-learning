# Deep Reinforcement Learning - Collaboration and Competition

Author: Hafizur Rahman

## Project Overview
For this project, agents need to be trained in [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation.  Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping. 

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those **scores** is at least +0.5.


## Learning Algorithm
Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient method was used to solve the project.

Initially the observations were flattened and added to replay buffer and plain DDPG was tried. However, it did not seem to converge at all.

As mentioned in benchmark implementation, it was noted that each agent receives its own, local observation. Thus, so the code was modified to simultaneously train both agents through self-play. This MADDPG has 2 DDPG agents and experience is collected from both agents and added to a shared replay buffer.
